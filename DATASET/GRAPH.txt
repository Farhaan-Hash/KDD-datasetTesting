

1e8 is standard scientific notion, and here it indicates an overall scale factor for the y-axis. 
That is, if there's a 2 on the y-axis and a 1e8 at the top, the value at 2 actually indicates 2*1e8 = 2e8 = 2 * 10^8 = 200,000,000.

Note that exp(20) = 4.85e8 and exp(3) = 20.1, and since the first number is too large to conveniently express directly and 
the second one can be expressed directly, you have the scientific notation in the first and not (explicitely) in the second.
