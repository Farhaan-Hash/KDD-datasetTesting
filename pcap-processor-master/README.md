# Pcap Processor
Read and process pcap files using this nifty tool.

This tool can read pcap files, process them internally and write them to one or more sinks.
Currently there are mappers written for pcap length conversion and protocol normalization.
I also have written sinks to write the pcap file to console, csv file or http endpoint.

```text
usage: pcap-processor [-h] [--map {length,protocol}]
                      [--sink {console,kafka,http,csv,grpc}] [--version]
                      file [file ...]

Read and process pcap files using this nifty tool.

positional arguments:
  file                  pcap file to read

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --map {length,protocol}
                        enable a mapper with the given name. You can use this
                        option multiple times to enable more than one mappers
  --sink {console,kafka,http,csv,grpc}
                        enable a sink with the given name. You can use this
                        option multiple times to enable more than one sinks
  --version             show program's version number and exit
```

## Note

Currently the `pcap-processor` reads only packets with IP or IPV6 layers. Feel free to modify the code based on your requirement. If you find any enhancement, please send a Pull Request.

## Requirements

pcap-reader relies on external command line tool: `tshark` and some Python modules.

Install `tshark` using the following command in Ubuntu and its derivatives:

```bash
sudo apt install tshark
```

Install Python dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

ABSTRACT="Network intrusions can be modeled as anomalies in network traffic in which
the expected order of packets and their attributes deviate from regular
traffic. Algorithms that predict the next sequence of events based on
previous sequences are a promising avenue for detecting such anomalies. In
this paper, we present a novel multi-attribute model for predicting a
network packet sequence based on previous packets using a
sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) encoder-decoder model. This model is trained
on an attack-free dataset to learn the normal sequence of packets in TCP
connections and then it is used to detect anomalous packets in TCP traffic.
We show that in DARPA 1999 dataset, the proposed multi-attribute Seq2Seq
model detects anomalous raw TCP packets which are part of intrusions with
97\% accuracy. Also, it can detect selected intrusions in real-time with
100\% accuracy and outperforms existing algorithms based on recurrent
neural network models such as LSTM."

## Use Cases

Read a pcap file and send all packets to Apache Kafka:

```bash
python3 -m pcap_processor --sink kafka samples/cicids_2017.pcap
```

Read a pcap file, map protocols and write them to a CSV file:

```bash
python3 -m pcap_processor --map protocol --sink csv samples/cicids_2017.pcap
```

Mappers and sinks have their own properties. Please modify them in the relevant `plugins/<file>.py`.

For example, to change the output CSV file location, modify the `self.path = "packets.csv"` in `pcap_processor/plugins/csv_sink.py`.
